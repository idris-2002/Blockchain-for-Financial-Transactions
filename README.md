# Blockchain for Financial Transactions

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple **blockchain system** implemented in Python to record financial transactions securely. It helps solve one of the biggest problems in digital finance: **double spending** and **tampering of transaction records**.

## 🚀 Features

* Add financial transactions (sender, receiver, amount).
* Store transactions in **blocks** linked together using cryptographic hashes.
* Prevent tampering by verifying the chain structure.
* Provides transparency and trust without a central authority.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Each transaction (e.g., Alice sends 100 to Bob) is added to the list of **pending transactions**.
2. When a block is created (mined), all pending transactions are stored inside it.
3. Each block contains:

   * Index
   * Timestamp
   * Transactions
   * Hash of the previous block
4. Blocks are linked together, making the chain **immutable**.

## 💡 Why Blockchain in Finance?

* **No Double Spending**: Once recorded, a transaction cannot be spent again.
* **Security**: Transactions are protected by cryptographic hashing.
* **Transparency**: All transactions are visible in the chain.
* **Decentralization**: Removes the need for a single central bank authority.

## ▶️ Example Usage

```bash
# Add transactions
finance_chain.add_transaction("Alice", "Bob", 100)
finance_chain.add_transaction("Bob", "Charlie", 50)

# Mine block
finance_chain.create_block(previous_hash=Blockchain.hash(finance_chain.last_block))

# View chain
for block in finance_chain.chain:
    print(block)
```

## ✅ Sample Output

```json
{
    "index": 2,
    "timestamp": 1693200301.456,
    "transactions": [
        {"sender": "Alice", "receiver": "Bob", "amount": 100},
        {"sender": "Bob", "receiver": "Charlie", "amount": 50}
    ],
    "previous_hash": "a37bc92f1..."
}
```

Do you want me to make this README **short (1-page)** for assignment submission or **detailed (like GitHub project)**?
